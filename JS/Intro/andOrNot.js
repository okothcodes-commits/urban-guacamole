/* 
Comparison Operators
Compariso operatis only evaluate true or false.

And Operators
And => &&
For this, we need a truth table
The idea is that it looks at all possible combinations
Eg. Val1 and Val2, so for this, all the combinations are:
Val1 && Val2 and then Val2 && Val1

&&(and) and ||(or) work with truthy and falsy
