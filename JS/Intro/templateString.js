// cos - finds the cosine of an angle (angle must be in radians, not degrees)
// tan - finds the tangent of an angle (also needs radians)
// log - finds the natural logarithm of a number (log base e, not base 10)
// pow - raises a number to a power, like base^exponent (e.g. Math.pow(2,3) = 8)

Modulus is a bit special
When you use it, divide two numbers, the output you get is the remainder when the number is divided
